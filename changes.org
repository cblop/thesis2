* Matt Thompson: Corrections
** Moved chapter three to chapter six and renamed
Chapter three ("Logic, Norms and Institutions as Story Worlds") has been moved from after the "Literature Review" chapter to after the "StoryBuilder" chapter, so that it is now chapter six.

The chapter has also been renamed to "Using TropICAL with a Multi-Agent System"
** Removed section on modelling Punch and Judy with modal logic and Kripke structures
# TODO: page number
