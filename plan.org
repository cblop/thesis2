** Notes
*** Compilation Strategy

1. Parse entity definitions
2. Parse rest of trope, inserting entity defs
3. Transform parse tree into hash map (examples of both in appendix)
4. Generate code from hash map

So, I think for each thing that is compiled (inits, terms, gens, etc), best to list the steps the code goes through. The key process is to describe the extraction of parameters into letters.

**** Get-params
1. Find all the events that can happen in the trope (including branches, etc): {:event {:verb go :role hero :object home}}
2. Get all of the roles, objects and places from the trope (from the defs)
3. Assign unique alphabet letters to all roles, objects and places (in that order)
**** Fluent decs
**** Initiates
**** Terminates
**** Generates
1. Get mapping of alphabetical letters to entities (this must always be the same)
2. Get events (minus obligations) that occur in the trope
3. Get obligations that happen
4. 
**** Initially

  CLOSED: [2017-09-27 Wed 07:18]
The literature review in Chapter 2 identifies with current approaches to interactive storytelling in Section 2.2.6:

Issue 1: Character agents need some freedom to generate story details
Issue 2: Story authors do not want to think in terms of goals.
Issue 3: Most narrative systems use outdated, inflexible story models.

We address issues 2 and 3 by allowing creators to describe their narrative components informally, using story tropes. [define tropes]
Tropes address issue 2 by allowing an author to describe the events that occur at different parts in a story. As tropes can describe patterns that occur across stories, they can be re-used and combined together in a way that allows an author to think about the story structure rather than the goals and workings of a planner. Tropes address issue 3 by providing an expressive, informal alternative to a strict formalism such as Propp's ``Morphology''. Formalisms require their users to learn their constituent rules in order to be useful. Our trope-based approach aims to allow the user to describe the parts of their story in as close to natural language as possible, while still allowing for their translation to a formal representation.
This is implemented through a controlled natural language approach to the specification of Tropes in our TropICAL programming language, described in Chapter 5.
