** Notes
*** Compilation Strategy

1. Parse entity definitions
2. Parse rest of trope, inserting entity defs
3. Transform parse tree into hash map (examples of both in appendix)
4. Generate code from hash map

So, I think for each thing that is compiled (inits, terms, gens, etc), best to list the steps the code goes through. The key process is to describe the extraction of parameters into letters.

**** Get-params
1. Find all the events that can happen in the trope (including branches, etc): {:event {:verb go :role hero :object home}}
2. Get all of the roles, objects and places from the trope (from the defs)
3. Assign unique alphabet letters to all roles, objects and places (in that order)
**** Fluent decs
**** Initiates
**** Terminates
**** Generates
1. Get mapping of alphabetical letters to entities (this must always be the same)
2. Get events (minus obligations) that occur in the trope
3. Get obligations that happen
4. 
**** Initially
