** 1 Marking Changes
For the corrections, please provide a short document detailing how you addressed our concerns. Please use the changebars package or colour where you have changed/added text unless it concerns typos.
** 2 Requested Changes
*** 2.1 Contribution of the dissertation
The contribution of the dissertation, as discussed during the viva, should be an interpretation of the theory of Propp using Tropes and a normative multi-agent system.
*** 2.2 Revise the introductory chapters
**** 2.2.1 Rewrite the introduction (chapter 1) to rephrase the overall objectives of the thesis ensuring that humbler appropriate objectives are set. This was because the objectives in the original introduction could not be seen to be supported by the results in the thesis.
**** 2.2.2 Tidy-up the literature review (chapter 2) in light of discussion in the viva: your approach is also planning, is maybe not as interactive as you claim. Tone down some of your critique.
*** 2.3 Bringing the contribution to the forefront
Reorganise the bulk of the contribution - which was presented in chapters 3 (on institutions), 4 (on tropes), 5 (on the TropICAL language) and 6 (StoryBuilder plus some evaluation of it) - by shifting the example of how the Punch and Judy experience can be phrased in terms of institutions towards the end. This would present two advantages:
- There would be no need to first explain the Punch and Judy experience in terms of Proppian functions and then re-explain it in terms of tropes (a single explanation in terms of tropes would suffice)
- The example in terms of institutions would serve to exemplify how the rest of the developments (the trope representation, the TropICAL language and the StoryBuilder application) would allow users to access significant expressive and computational power for their stories
**** 2.3.1 Rearrange the chapters and rewrite the connecting text to support this:
a. New chapter 3 - Current chapter 4
b. New chapter 4 - Current chapter 5
c. New chapter 5 - Current chapter 6 excluding the evaluation
d. New chapter 6 - Current chapter 3 from on section 3.3 in the context of how to combine StoryBuilder with agents
e. New chapter 7 - new chapter: Evaluation and Validation: including the work on evaluation already present in the original version (section 6.3) but also possibly the questionnaire appearing in Appendix A and reference to the thematic analysis transcripts in Appendix E
**** 2.3.2 The new chapter needs to include:
a. A full specification of Punch and Judy
b. Add an example of "Character Freedom", as in breaking away from the norms
c. Evaluation of your own approach against interactive criteria (from the lit. review), including complexity.
**** 2.3.3 Add a discussion of how to combine tropes
*** 2.4 Other additions and Changes
**** 2.4.1 Explain the Hashmaps: what are they
**** 2.4.2 Provide a short introduction to ASP and InstAL including why you selected them
**** 2.4.3 Add pagerefs when you are referring to sections/tables/figures in other chapters (the fancyref package does this for you).
* General
** TODO fix ambiguous meanings of "role"
** TODO rewrite many parts (intro, etc) with Tropes as the main argument
** TODO remove the logic section
** TODO Use \pageref{}s everywhere
* Preamble
** TODO Is it Digital Media or Digital Entertainment?
* Introduction
- Much is promised at the start, but what has vs hasn't been delivered needs to be summarised at the end. Trim it down.
- Tone down the harsh criticisms (or make a better system).
- Build the argument around _tropes_
* Lit Review
** TODO Propp is a _formalist_
** TODO remove bit about structuralists
** TODO Barthes, etc, are more flexible, but not used by CS researchers
** TODO Too many different plot models. Remove unless you can refer back to them from later
** TODO Need to refer back to Aarseth from later chapters, comparing it with my stuff
** TODO _Perspective_: is the audience a character? Refer back to Aarseth.
** TODO Describe how your system is interactive in accordance with Crawford's description
** TODO Delete mention of Fabula & Syuzhet if you're not going to use it
** TODO Propp uses _character functions_, not story functions
*Story moves* are lots of character functions grouped together
** TODO No need to mention French Structuralists
** TODO Pg. 23: define "DSL"
** TODO All lit review stuff should be referred back to later if you mention it. Grammar stuff, etc.
** TODO Need examples of plans and planning operators
** TODO But only use examples when you're going to refer back to them. Too many complex, unused examples in this lit review.
** TODO Pg. 29: Replace Mateus et al with bibtex citation
** TODO Exclusion, deontic, etc need to be explained. Same with constitutive vs regulative.
** TODO Watch out for first person stuff. Do a search.
** TODO How could you use institutional powers to _prevent_ things from happening?
** TODO Pg. 37: Cite paper on appraisal theory.
** TODO Introduce the problem in lit. rev discussion first, then... (?)
** TODO Demonstrate how your approach can be used to enrich plans rather than alienating the planner people.
** TODO Don't diss Propp: "Recovering the flexibility that Propp intended"
** TODO Ending of lit. rev. is contestable. No need to argue at the end.
** TODO Pablo's reuse of Propp for musicals (adaptation). Use this as a motivation for tropes.
* Institutions
** TODO Use an alternative example of why abstraction - just being able to embed is enough. At the very least give a theoretical example
** TODO Find matching tropes that match a violation
** TODO Introduce new tropes - as a way of introducing freedom
** TODO Bridge institutions are not explained. Refer to a paper rather than TingTing's dissertation.
** TODO Too many different types of violations: Propp, insts, etc. Make it clear.
** TODO Check which version of InstAL you're using. Exogenous events (rather than institutional ones) have empowerment now.
** TODO Could use empowerment to "ignore" certain character actions, so violations are more meaningful.
** TODO Link roles back to the literature
** TODO Can use InstAL's domain file & types to assign roles to agents
** TODO Come up with examples of how your tropes are reusable
** TODO Show 3 instances (examples) that show tropes are reusable.
** TODO Would be good to show different instances of the same story. Or _all_ of P&J.
** TODO Put the full code of P&J in the appendix.
** TODO ASP is never explained
** TODO Why is efficiency a problem? Breadth-first search
** TODO Pg. 76: Address how these affect the player
** TODO Two layers: action performed and their meaning (semantics)
** TODO Would be good to specify what would happen in the case of a violation
** TODO End of the TropICAL section (or in the appendix) should be some kind of user manual for TropICAL. Give a worked example of its use.
** TODO Explain in future work if bridges are necessary. May want instead to compile it all into the same file.
** TODO Pg. 115: No violations in the visualisation by default, but add if nodes are clicked on.
** TODO Explain about combining tropes. Put this into the section on tropes. Give an example of what would happen if you combined tropes.
** TODO Pg. 119: Author may want to have a say in how tropes are combined. Reduce the number of possibilities.
** TODO Have a way of specifying where a trope can be _broken_ -> constraints
** TODO Rather than having multiple institutions at the same time, consider compiling them into the same trope
** TODO You have used a naive way of combining tropes. The results of the user study motivates the use of constraints.
** TODO Explain UP FRONT that the roles, etc are simplified (e.g. not named instances)
** TODO Explain how the 5-event limit could be overcome through sequentially composing tropes.
* Tropes
** TODO change Propp & PJ institution, replace with one of the tropes from earlier
* TropICAL
** TODO how does it save time? What work will it save?
* StoryBuilder
** TODO how does it save time? What work will it save?
* Intelligent Agents
** TODO signpost that the player's interaction is _limited_ in the case of P&J
It's actually pretty interesting that the player's interaction is limited: make the most of describing this
** TODO how would all this be applied in the traditional case where the user is free?
** TODO could use empowerment as a way of terminating all permissions when character dies
** TODO discuss the role of the player
As audience, but also using more complicated examples
* Evaluation
** TODO make a separate chapter
"System Validation" (evaluation)
** TODO chapter structure
- StoryBuilder user stories
** TODO interesting examples of story violations for P&J
- Address that some participants in the eval would actually prefer to use planners
* Future Work
** TODO role(A,B) is a fudge: explain how to do it better with types
** TODO explain why TropICAL and StoryBuilder are time-saving. What work do they save?
** TODO Be careful of the multiple meanings of "role"
