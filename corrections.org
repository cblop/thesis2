* Check
- Where does ASP stuff have to go?
- Compare by referring back to other approaches.
- Where does the discussion on how to combine tropes go?
- Outline in general terms what you wanted to be able to do, what the technical demands are. Why you concluded this was a more productive way forward vs changing Inform. Makes system entirely under my control.
* General
** TODO fix ambiguous meanings of "role"
** TODO rewrite many parts (intro, etc) with Tropes as the main argument
** TODO remove the logic section
** TODO Use \pageref{}s everywhere
* Preamble
** TODO Is it Digital Media or Digital Entertainment?
* Introduction
- Much is promised at the start, but what has vs hasn't been delivered needs to be summarised at the end. Trim it down.
- Tone down the harsh criticisms (or make a better system).
- Build the argument around _tropes_
* Lit Review
** TODO Propp is a _formalist_
** TODO remove bit about structuralists
** TODO Barthes, etc, are more flexible, but not used by CS researchers
** TODO Too many different plot models. Remove unless you can refer back to them from later
** TODO Need to refer back to Aarseth from later chapters, comparing it with my stuff
** TODO _Perspective_: is the audience a character? Refer back to Aarseth.
** TODO Describe how your system is interactive in accordance with Crawford's description
** TODO Delete mention of Fabula & Syuzhet if you're not going to use it
** TODO Propp uses _character functions_, not story functions
*Story moves* are lots of character functions grouped together
** TODO No need to mention French Structuralists
** TODO Pg. 23: define "DSL"
** TODO All lit review stuff should be referred back to later if you mention it. Grammar stuff, etc.
** TODO Need examples of plans and planning operators
** TODO But only use examples when you're going to refer back to them. Too many complex, unused examples in this lit review.
** TODO Pg. 29: Replace Mateus et al with bibtex citation
** TODO Exclusion, edontic, etc need to be explained. Same with constitutive vs regulative.
** TODO Watch out for first person stuff. Do a search.
** TODO Houw could you use institutional powers to _prevent_ things from happening?
** TODO Pg. 37: Cite paper on appraisal theory.
** TODO Introduce the problem in lit. rev discussion first, then... (?)
** TODO Demonstrate how your approach can be used to enrich plans rather than alienating the planner people.
** TODO Don't diss Propp: "Recovering the flexibility that Propp intended"
** TODO Ending of lit. rev. is contestable. No need to argue at the end.
** TODO Pablo's reuse of Propp for musicals (adaptation). Use this as a motivation for tropes.
* Institutions
** TODO Use an alternative example of why abstraction - just being able to embed is enough. At the very least give a theoretical example
** TODO Find matching tropes that match a violation
** TODO Introduce new tropes - as a way of introducing freedom
** TODO Bridge institutions are not explained. Refer to a paper rather than TingTing's dissertation.
** TODO Too many different types of violations: Propp, insts, etc. Make it clear.
** TODO Check which version of InstAL you're using. Exogenous events (rather than institutional ones) have empowerment now.
** TODO Could use empowerment to "ignore" certain character actions, so violations are more meaningful.
** TODO Link roles back to the literature
** TODO Can use InstAL's domain file & types to assign roles to agents
** TODO Come up with examples of how your tropes are reusable
** TODO Show 3 instances (examples) that show tropes are reusable.
** TODO Would be good to show different instances of the same story. Or _all_ of P&J.
** TODO Put the full code of P&J in the appendix.
** TODO ASP is never explained
** TODO Why is efficiency a problem? Breadth-first search
** TODO Pg. 76: Address how these affect the player
** TODO Two layers: action performed and their meaning (semantics)
** TODO Would be good to specify what would happen in the case of a violation
** TODO End of the TropICAL section (or in the appendix) should be some kind of user manual for TropICAL. Give a worked example of its use.
** TODO Explain in future work if bridges are necessary. May want instead to compile it all into the same file.
** TODO Pg. 115: No violations in the visualisation by default, but add if nodes are clicked on.
** TODO Explain about combining tropes. Put this into the section on tropes. Give an example of what would happen if you combined tropes.
** TODO Pg. 119: Author may want to have a say in how tropes are combined. Reduce the number of possibilities.
** TODO Have a way of specifying where a trope can be _broken_ -> constraints
** TODO Rather than having multiple institutions at the same time, consider compiling them into the same trope
** TODO You have used a naive way of combining tropes. The results of the user study motivates the use of constraints.
** TODO Explain UP FRONT that the roles, etc are simplified (e.g. not named instances)
** TODO Explain how the 5-event limit could be overcome through sequentially composing tropes.
* Tropes
** TODO change Propp & PJ institution, replace with one of the tropes from earlier
* TropICAL
** TODO how does it save time? What work will it save?
* StoryBuilder
** TODO how does it save time? What work will it save?
* Intelligent Agents
** TODO signpost that the player's interaction is _limited_ in the case of P&J
It's actually pretty interesting that the player's interaction is limited: make the most of describing this
** TODO how would all this be applied in the traditional case where the user is free?
** TODO could use empowerment as a way of terminating all permissions when character dies
** TODO discuss the role of the player
As audience, but also using more complicated examples
* Evaluation
** TODO make a separate chapter
"System Validation" (evaluation)
** TODO chapter structure
- StoryBuilder user stories
** TODO interesting examples of story violations for P&J
- Address that some participants in the eval would actually prefer to use planners
* Future Work
** TODO role(A,B) is a fudge: explain how to do it better with types
** TODO explain why TropICAL and StoryBuilder are time-saving. What work do they save?
** TODO Be careful of the multiple meanings of "role"
