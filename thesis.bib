        abstract = {Institutions (also called normative frameworks) provide an effective mechanism to govern agents in open intelligent systems. An institution specifies a set of norms, with respect to specific normative objectives, that regulate agents? behaviours in terms of permissions, empowerments and obligations. However, in most real circumstances, several institutions probably have to cooperate to govern the same entities simultaneously, which is referred as cooperating institutions in this dissertation. Depending on how individual institutions are connected with each other, three different ways of forming a cooperating institution are addressed: coordinated institutions, interacting institutions and merged institutions. The dissertation firstly presents a formal and computational model for all three types of combination. Furthermore, when agent behaviour is regulated by a cooperating institution, consisting of a set of independently-designed institutions, normative conflicts are likely to arise, as each individual institution has its own objective. For instance, a certain action may be permitted (or obliged) by a norm from one institution while being prohibited by a norm from another institution. A blunt solution is to ignore or delete the conflicting norm(s) from one or the other institution. A further contribution of this dissertation is however the development of a formally justified fine-grained approach operating on parts of norms that is able to: (i) detect normative conflicts automatically for all the three variants of cooperating institutions, and (ii) resolve these conflicts by automatically constructing a minimal revision of the conflicting norms through inductive learning. In this work, we start with formalising three types of cooperating institution by means of an institutional action language (InstAL ), which can be automatically translated into logic programs under Answer Set semantics. Based on that, we then put forward an automatic procedure that can identify the normative conflicts that may arise, and transform them into negative examples to feed our conflict resolution system implemented by Inductive Logic Programming, through which the conflict-free cooperating institution can be derived by revision of the norms belonging to specific identified institutions. We further demonstrate the proposed conflicts detection and resolution approach in several case studies from the domain of multi-agent systems and legal systems.}

Increasingly, applications in education, training, and entertainment are leveraging narrative to create rich interactive experiences in virtual storyworlds. A key challenge posed by these environments is devising accurate models of director agents’ strategies that determine the most appropriate director action to perform for crafting customized story experiences. A promising approach is developing an empirically informed model of director agents’ decision-making strategies. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning models of director agent decision-making strategies by observing human-human interactions in an interactive narrative-centered learning environment. The results are encouraging and suggest that creating empirically driven models of director agent decision-making is a promising approach to interactive narrative.},

A process called mediation addresses this issue by selecting appropriate responses to possible detrimental user actions in a given interactive narrative plan. One way the algorithm mediates exceptional user activity is accommodation, the process of replanning future events to incorporate an unwanted action and accomplish the story's authorial goals. However, this approach is limited by an underlying assumption that the story world exists as an object outside the user's subjective experience. In this paper, we incorporate a model of user knowledge into plan-based mediation in order to widen the space of plans the algorithm may search during accommodation by allowing the process to replan past events that occur outside a user's imperfect knowledge of the story world.},

Marlinspike selects the next scene to play so as to reincorporate — or narratively build upon — as much of the story-so-far as possible. In accordance with an Aristotelian definition of narrative unity, this reincorporation serves to make earlier events--particularly the player's actions--narratively necessary to the finished story. An evaluation with human players of Marlinspike's novel reincorporation feature produced mixed results. On the one hand, reincorporation does indeed produce internal story structures that are more unified and that include more of the players' significant actions. However, the players themselves did not report a correspondingly improved experience of either story quality or story-level agency.},
